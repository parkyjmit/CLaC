       "[['Exploring ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) solid electrolytes with fast ion transport is highly desirable in nanoelectronics, ionic devices and various energy storage systems, following the rapid scaling of devices to the nanometer scale. Herein, two-dimensional (2D) metal trihalides MX3 (ScCl3, ScBr3, AsI3, ScI3, YBr3, SbI3, YI3 and BiI3) with intrinsic atomic pore structures have been examined and found to be promising as realistic 2D solid electrolytes. Through examining the binding interactions and the diffusion barriers of monolayer MX3-ion (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) systems by utilizing first principles calculations, it is found that MX3-ion complexes are energetically favorable and the energy barriers of some MX3-ion systems are comparable to or even smaller than those of the conventional solid electrolyte systems. More significantly, the short diffusion time of Na+ and K+ ions in some monolayers MX3 at the nanosecond (ns) or even at the sub-ns scale indicates fast ion transport. In terms of practical applications, ultrafast Li+ travelling in the timescale of sub-ns to ns and Na+ in several tens ns in few-layer MX3 is achieved. In addition, the insulating nature of wide band gaps for MX3 is maintained during the ion transport, which is essential for solid electrolytes. These theoretical results provide fundamental guidance that MX3 materials with natural atomic pores are realistic candidates for 2D solid electrolytes with broad applications in ionic devices and energy storage devices.',\n",
       "  'Fast ion transport in electrolytes is required for the rapid development of portable devices such as ionic memory devices and mobile energy storage devices. The device performance, determined by switching the speed of memory devices and the power density of energy storage devices, is directly correlated with the speed of ion transport. Traditional liquid electrolytes, such as LiPF6 and LiBF4 dissolved in organic solvents, have demonstrated excellent ion transport performance with an ionic conductivity of 10-2 S cm-1. However, crucial safety issues have caused fire accidents because organic liquid electrolytes are highly flammable and show low thermal stability. In contrast, inorganic solid electrolytes are promising candidates to replace the liquid electrolytes since they possess several superior advantages over the liquid electrolytes, such as lower flammability, better safety, better chemical stability and suppression of dendritic growth. In the past few years, several types of solid electrolytes have been explored, including garnet-type, sulfide-type, perovskite-type, etc. Currently, one issue of the conventional bulk solid electrolytes is their limited ionic conductivity. For example, the ionic conductivities of Li3PS4 and LiTi2(PO4)3 are as low as 10-7 and 10-6 S cm-1 at room temperature, respectively. By partial elemental substitution of Ti4+ by Al3+, the ionic conductivity of LiTi2(PO4)3 can be increased to 10-3 S cm-1 due to the increased Li vacancies and decreased energy barriers. For solid polymer electrolytes of polyethylene oxide (PEO), the ionic conductivity is also only up to 10-4 S cm-1 after combining with nanoscale filler materials such as Al2O3 and SiO2, which is still two orders of magnitude lower than those of liquid electrolytes at room temperature.In fact, ion transport in solid electrolytes is determined by their transport kinetic pathways. The ion-hopping migration in conventional inorganic solid electrolytes depends on vacancies and interstitial sites. It is noted that the transport becomes difficult as long as some interstitial sites or atomic vacancies are blocked as in grain boundaries and interfaces, which further reduces the ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the ion transport is highly disordered due to the complex atomic structure of solid electrolytes, suppressing the fast ion diffusion to some extent. Remarkably, some solid electrolytes of super ionic conductors (SIC) as promising candidates have been reported with a lower energy barrier (Ea) of Li+ ion transport ~0.2-0.3 eV and a higher ionic conductivity of ~10-3-10-2 S cm-1 for Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) and Li7La3Zr2O12 at room temperature, owing to the concerted ion migration. However, combined with the experimental preparation techniques of spin-coating or drop-casting, the thickness of the solid electrolytes usually reaches tens of nanometers or even thicker, as polycrystalline films with multiple grain boundaries prolong the ion transport distance greatly. Even though the thickness of the bulk solid electrolytes could be reduced to the sub-nanometer scale, achieving the high interface quality between the electrolytes and the electrodes due to dangling bonds and film thickness variations is still challenging. In addition, following the continuous and rapid scaling of electronic devices to the nanometer scale, ultrathin solid electrolytes are highly desirable for applications in non-volatile ionic devices. Therefore, designing ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) solid electrolytes is critical to meet the requirement of the nanosecond (ns) scale for fast ion transport in next-generation ionic devices.Recently, organic crown ethers (CEs) as 2D solid electrolytes have been proposed, and fast ion transport was also examined in our previous work. However, weak interactions between the CEs and the electrodes such as graphene and the possible lateral movement of CEs on the 2D electrode make it difficult to achieve one uniform layer of CEs on a large scale. Therefore, realistic 2D solid electrolytes with sub-nanometer thickness, free of dangling bonds, and full coverage of 2D electrode materials are desirable to realize fast ion transport. To achieve these goals, 2D layered materials with various artificially formed nanopores have been explored to examine their feasibility in ion transport. Specifically, graphene prepared with nanopores is a promising candidate for ion transport. As is shown, the graphene nanopores through introducing C vacancies can facilitate the transport of Na+ and K+ ions in graphene. However, the ion transport performance is basically dependent on the pore size, pore density and interaction between the ions and the edge atoms around the nanopores. Although the sub-nanometer pores as small as 3 A in graphene can be achieved with the rapid development of etching nanotechnology, the size distribution of nanopores is dispersive with irregular shapes. To date, the pore density of ~1012 cm-2 can be obtained by using oxygen plasma. Nevertheless, the larger pore density might be difficult to realize since the pore density is sensitive to the experimental environment. Meanwhile, the edge atoms around the pores possessing dangling bonds would induce the interaction or reaction with the passing ions. From the viewpoint of practical applications, actual crystalline 2D solid electrolytes possessing large electronic band gaps are highly desirable with intrinsic, high density and uniform-size atomic pores to facilitate ion transport.In our recent work, a novel family of 2D metal trihalide MX3 materials (ScCl3, ScBr3, AsI3, ScI3, YBr3, SbI3, YI3 and BiI3) with natural atomic pores and large band gaps have been proposed. MX3 materials are dynamically stable according to the phonon spectra exploration. In addition, the cleavage energy of MX3 is smaller than that of graphene, indicating that it is feasible to exfoliate them from their corresponding bulk materials. More significantly, the natural atomic pores with uniform size and sufficient density within MX3 imply the possible fast ion transport through MX3, which makes MX3 promising as realistic 2D solid electrolytes with broad applications. Thus, it is very essential to explore the ion diffusion process through MX3 pores in order to examine the feasibility of MX3 as 2D solid electrolytes.Based on these observations, we have investigated the practical performance of 2D MX3 materials (ScCl3, ScBr3, ScI3, AsI3, YBr3, YI3, SbI3, and BiI3) with precise atomic pores as 2D solid electrolytes for Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ cations transport by utilizing first principles calculations. We have examined the binding energy to demonstrate the stability of monolayer MX3-ion complexes. The energy barriers of the ion transport through monolayer MX3 are also calculated to assess the ion diffusion performance. In order to provide direct guidance for experiments, the ion diffusion time in monolayer MX3 is estimated. Furthermore, the energy barriers and diffusion time of the ion transport in few-layer MX3 are also explored considering the practical applications of devices. Besides, the electronic structures of MX3 materials during the ion transport process are also investigated to examine their insulating nature. These results would offer fundamental guidance for 2D MX3 materials with intrinsic atomic pores as realistic 2D solid electrolytes for applications in ionic devices and energy storage devices.',\n",
       "  'Besides the energetically stable monolayer MX3-ion structures, a small Ea of the ion diffusion through MX3 is expected to achieve fast ion transport as ideal 2D solid electrolytes. Therefore, the ion diffusion processes and the Ea of ions through monolayer MX3 pores have been thoroughly examined. Here, ScCl3-ion complexes are also selected as examples. For smaller ions of Li+ and Mg2+ trapped within the pores of ScCl3, Ea is defined as the energy difference between the stable adsorption configuration of the ion on the ScCl3 surface and that of the ion trapped in the M atom plane, which is shown in Fig. 4(a). To identify the stable surface adsorption configurations, the top sites vertically above one of the Sc atoms (Sc-top) and the Cl atoms (Cl-top) are both considered. The energies of the ScCl3-Li+ complex with Sc-top and Cl-top sites are higher than that of the trapped site by 0.46 eV and 0.84 eV, respectively. Thus, Ea is ~0.46 eV with respect to Li+ diffusing through ScCl3 in Fig. 4(a). In contrast, Mg2+ shows a large Ea of 1.42 eV, even though its ionic radius is similar to that of Li+, which is resulted from the strong binding between Mg2+ and ScCl3 in Fig. 3(d).For relatively larger ions of Ca2+, Na+, and K+, their favourable binding sites are vertically located above the pores of ScCl3, which is defined as the initial state (IS). The mirror symmetric configuration relative to the IS is defined as the final state (FS). The transition state (TS) corresponds to the ions situated within the Sc atom plane, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The energy barrier curves of Na+ and Ca2+ through the ScCl3 pores show two peaks in Fig. 4(b) and (d), and their diffusion barriers are ~0.16 eV and ~0.54 eV. These two peaks correspond to Na+ or Ca2+ passing through the top and bottom Cl atom planes along the diffusion pathway. Then, the relative energy reduces to the minimum with Na+ or Ca2+ situated in the Sc atom plane. For K+ with the largest ionic radius, it is difficult to reach the TS and the energy barrier curve in Fig. 4(c) behaves like a volcano with Ea ~ 0.90 eV. Meanwhile, more images in CI-NEB calculations are examined to obtain more accurate energy barrier curves of ScCl3-Na+ and ScCl3-K+ systems. However, more images in NEB calculations do not influence the energy barrier values but the fine structures of the curves due to the structural symmetries of the studied systems. With the ions diffusing through atomic pores, the M-X bond lengths and the pore sizes of MX3 change. For example, in ScCl3-ion systems, the pristine pore size of ScCl3 is 4.72 A, and it changes to 4.46 A, 4.69 A and 5.09 A in transition states for ScCl3-Li+, ScCl3-Na+ and ScCl3-K+, respectively. So, the obtained energy barriers here are reasonable. Furthermore, the flexible and ultrathin properties of these 2D MX3 indicate that they are suitable to be realistic 2D solid electrolytes.Generally, it is seen that Ea is related to the ionic radius, the pore size of monolayer MX3 and the binding interaction strength between the ions and MX3. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Ea of monolayer MX3-Li+ systems is in the range of ~0.46 eV-0.57 eV due to the small ionic radius of Li+. In contrast, monolayer MX3-Mg2+ systems in Fig. 5(a) show higher Ea owing to the stronger binding interactions between Mg2+ and MX3, even though the ionic radius of Mg2+ is also small. More importantly, it is seen that Na+ easily travels through monolayer ScCl3 and ScBr3 with an Ea of 0.16 eV and 0.29 eV, as shown in Fig. 5(a), which is comparable to the Ea of ~0.25 eV of the current high-performance Na+ solid electrolytes. Since Na+ would be trapped within the pores of larger pore size MX3, except for ScCl3 and ScBr3, the Ea is determined by the difficulty of pulling Na+ from the pores to the surfaces of MX3. Therefore, the larger the pore size, the greater the Ea is. Different from other ions, K+ possesses the largest ionic radius and its favorable binding site is above MX3 monolayer. With K+ approaching the M atom plane under the TS, the total energy of the MX3-K+ complex gradually enhances. Thus, the Ea of K+ is determined by the relative energy between the TS state and the binding state shown in Fig. 4(c). Compared with ScCl3 and ScBr3, K+ travels through other MX3 with larger pore size more easily and Ea is in the range from ~0.21 eV to ~0.33 eV, as shown in Fig. 5(a). Although the ionic radius of Ca2+ is similar to that of Na+, the Ea of MX3-Ca2+ systems is much higher than that of MX3-Na+ systems, as shown in Fig. 5(a), due to the stronger binding interactions between Ca2+ and MX3, as shown in Fig. 3(e).In order to provide more direct references for experiments, the diffusion time (t) of these ions in monolayer MX3 has also been estimated according to the Arrhenius formula, which is listed in Table S2 of the ESI,+where Ea(ion) is the energy barrier of ions diffusing through monolayer MX3 (in Table S2 of the ESI),+n* is the lattice vibrational frequency (1012-1013 Hz, here 1013 Hz is adopted), kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the room temperature set as 300 K.Since the diffusion time rapidly increases with the increase in the Ea, the fast ion transport is likely to be realized in Li+, Na+, and K+ coupled with monolayer MX3 systems, as shown in Fig. 5(b). It is clearly observed that the diffusion time of Li+ travelling through the atomic pores of MX3 is comparable to that of the current solid electrolytes, such as ~0.50 eV in Li5La3Ta2O12 and ~0.45 eV in LiTi2(PO4)3, indicating the promising applications of monolayer MX3 in ionic memory devices, lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, etc. Additionally, the ionic devices using Na+ have also attracted great attention due to their abundance and low cost. Nonetheless, the current essential issue is to improve the Na+ transport performance to meet the requirement of fast ionic devices through exploring the promising solid electrolytes. Fortunately, the diffusion time of Na+ travelling through the monolayer MX3 of ScCl3 and ScBr3 is sub-ns and ns scale due to the small Ea of less than 0.30 eV, indicating that monolayers ScCl3 and ScBr3 are promising as realistic 2D solid electrolytes in Na+ ionic devices. As the atomic pore size of MX3 increases, t(Na+) rapidly increases due to the enhanced Ea. Besides, it is noteworthy that K+ easily travels through monolayer MX3 with large pore size, which leads to the ultrafast transport of K+ at the ns or even at the sub-ns scale in monolayers AsI3, YBr3, SbI3, YI3, and BiI3. Considering the above diffusion time of the ions through the atomic pores of MX3, it is found that monolayer MX3 are very promising as realistic 2D solid electrolytes to realize ultrafast ion transport.',\n",
       "  'In terms of practical device applications, the geometrical structures and electronic properties of monolayer MX3 would be easily influenced by substrates and surrounding environments. Thus, 2D vdW few-layered or multilayered MX3 are more reliable than their monolayers. When the layer number of 2D vdW materials increases to more than n [?] 8 for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the multilayers show the bulk-like electronic properties. To gain more insight into the ion transport in multilayered MX3, the bulk MX3 is adopted to simulate the ion diffusion process in this work. The ion transport in multilayered MX3 is realized through travelling layer-by-layer due to the weak vdW interaction between interlayers. So, the ion diffusion process in any of layers could help unveil the ion transport in multilayered MX3. Since MX3 materials as hosts have intrinsic atomic pores, the MX3-ion transport could be attributed to the interstitial mechanism through the empty sites within the MX3 layers and between the MX3 layers. The whole process of ion diffusion in one layer is divided into two steps, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Step one is the intralayer diffusion corresponding to the ions travelling through the atomic pores of one layer, and step two is the interlayer diffusion referring to the ions diffusing between the two nearest neighboring layers. The energy barrier curves of the ion transport through multilayered MX3 represented by ScCl3 are shown as an example in Fig. S5 of the ESI.+ The detailed Ea of the ions travelling through the multilayered MX3 is shown in Fig. 7(a). Remarkably, the Ea of Li+ diffusion through MX3 is much reduced to the range of ~0.14-0.31 eV, which is comparable to or even smaller than that of Li+ transport in the current high-performance solid electrolytes.Similarly, the diffusion time of ions travelling through one layer of the multilayered MX3 is also shown in Fig. 7(b) based on the formula (2). It is worth mentioning that the diffusion time is the sum of two steps. It is clearly seen that Li+ travels very fast through MX3, and t(Li+) for one layer MX3 ranges from 0.03 ns to 22.70 ns, which is the fastest in all the investigated MX3 materials than that of other ions. Specially, Li+ travels through one layer of YBr3 within ~0.03 ns due to its smallest energy barriers, implying an ultrafast transport of Li+ in YBr3. The shortened diffusion time of Li+ through multilayered MX3 could be attributed to the interaction between layers that assists Li+ ions travelling through the atomic pores of MX3 in the step one. In contrast, t(Na+) for one layer within multilayered MX3 is almost 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than t(Li+) due to the larger Ea of Na+. However, t(Na+) is still in the range of ~ns-ms, which would meet the switching speed requirement of Na+ ionic devices, particularly using multilayered YBr3 or SbI3 as solid electrolytes. Compared with t(Li+) and t(Na+), t(K+) is greatly increased due to its large Ea(ion), but it is still within ~ms-ms. Furthermore, the insulating nature of MX3 shown in Fig. S6 and S7 of the ESI+ is well reserved during the ion diffusion process. From these results, it is concluded that few-layer MX3 are ideal 2D vdW solid electrolytes for applications in future ultrafast ionic devices. Noticeably, MX3 is introduced as a 2D solid electrolyte with ultrathin thickness rather than a replacement for bulk inorganic solid electrolytes with macroscopic thickness. Different from the conventional solid electrolytes containing Li element, all Li+ ions are externally introduced in MX3 and they are all mobile. Additionally, one Li+ is introduced within four atomic pore structures in one MX3 layer, corresponding to the chemical formula of LixMX3 (x = 0.125) in our simulated supercell. The mobile Li+ ion density in 2D MX3 is not low compared with that of inorganic solid electrolytes such as Li3PS4 and LGPS. Besides, the ion diffusion barrier would be affected by the ion concentration, which influences the ion diffusion rate. When the ion concentration increases to four times in the same supercell of Fig. 1(c), the diffusion barriers and diffusion time of Li+ travelling one layer within multilayered MX3 are displayed in Fig. S8.+ It is found that the ion transport is affected to some extent in ScCl3 and ScBr3 possessing small pore sizes. In contrast, the effect of the ion density on the ion transport is little in 2D ultrathin MX3 with a large pore size. Consequently, the ~ns even sub-ns timescale diffusion through one layer is well preserved in AsI3, ScI3, YBr3, SbI3, YI3 and BiI3 systems. During the ion transport through the atomic pores of MX3, the pore size changes, indicating the good flexibility of 2D MX3. To obtain the exact ionic conductivity of these solid electrolytes, the thorough ion concentration and the ion diffusion barrier modulated by the ion-MX3 interaction are required to be further considered in future studies. Nevertheless, the diffusion barriers and diffusion time of ions through one layer MX3 within multilayered MX3 in this work would provide fundamental guidance for screening realistic 2D solid electrolytes. Besides, the phase stability of ScCl3 with the increase of Li+ ion density as an example is shown in Fig. S9 and discussed in the ESI.+In terms of practical applications, monolayer ScCl3 and ScBr3 are possible candidates for ultrafast Na+ devices, since the diffusion time of Na+ through them is at the sub-ns scale. Meanwhile, considering the Li+ transport performance and the chemical stability, almost all few-layered MX3 materials especially YBr3 and YI3 are promising and expected to be experimentally examined in ultrafast Li+ device design. In addition, the electrochemical stability and electrochemical window of 2D MX3 as solid electrolytes deserve to be further explored in future studies. These monolayers MX3 or few-layer MX3 could be exfoliated from their corresponding bulk materials due to the smaller cleavage energies (0.11-0.25 J m-2) or prepared by the chemical vapor deposition technique. Additionally, the preparation process of 2D MX3 needs to be performed in a water-free environment, similar to the black phosphorus preparation.'],\n",
       " ['Membrane technology has been widely applied in gas separation field. In this work, a series of two-dimensional (2D) metal trihalides MX3 (AsI3, ScI3, SbI3, YI3, BiI3, ScCl3, ScBr3 and YBr3) are expected to be served as realistic 2D molecular sieves in gas separation applications due to their intrinsically and uniformly well-defined atomic pores. The gas separation performance of these 2D MX3 molecular sieves has been systematically explored by using first-principles calculations. Different from the conventional membranes, the atomic pores of 2D MX3 molecular sieves behave like breathing mode via flexible change of M-X bond during the gas molecules transport process. These 2D MX3 molecular sieves exhibit excellent H2/CO and O2/N2 separation performance, which surpasses the state-of-the-art upper bound. Remarkably, the O2/N2 selectivity of YBr3, SbI3, YI3 and BiI3 molecular sieves is within the range of 102-103 under superior permeance, which exceeds that of common membranes (~101) to a large extent. The extremely high selectivity and superior permeance indicate that these 2D MX3 molecular sieves possess great potentials in gas separation applications.',\n",
       "  'Nowadays, energy crisis and environmental pollution issues become more and more serious due to a large amount of fossil energy consumption. Thus, it is essential to search for environmentally friendly energy in order to pursue sustainable development. As a promising clean energy, hydrogen energy is expected to help reduce environmental pollution [,]. So far, steam methane reforming is a widely adopted method for hydrogen production. However, a gas mixture of H2 with CO and other gases is generally produced. A tiny amount of CO through the proton exchange membrane would poison the Pt catalyst on the anode, which prevents the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in fuel cells. In order to obtain high-purity H2, it is very critical to separate H2 from CO and other mixed gases [,]. Besides the hydrogen purification, the enrichment of oxygen from the air is very essential for medical, aerospace applications and lots of industrial processes. The separation of O2/N2 gas pair is very significant such as in aircraft applications and oxy-fuel combustion processes. For the former case, the purified O2 can be supplied for human breathing, and the remaining N2 can be input into the fuel tank to avoid combustion and balance pressure. For the latter case, the coexistence of N2 and O2 would generate nitrogen oxides of NOx at high temperature, which induces serious air pollution. If O2 and N2 can be initially separated, the pollution of NOx could be reduced. The traditional cryogenic distillation technology for producing O2 from air requires ultralow temperature and high pressure, which is a high energy consumption process. Different from conventional separation process, gas separation using porous materials as membranes is a promising strategy owing to its low energy consumption, convenient operation and environmental friendliness [,].Porous materials are generally classified by their pore sizes (D pore) as microporous (D pore<2nm), mesoporous (2nm<D pore<50nm), and macroporous (D pore>50nm) materials. Micro- and meso-porous materials are scientifically and technologically important for their capability to interact with atoms, ions and molecules with selective adsorption and separation. The representative microporous material systems include zeolites of crystalline aluminosilicates with interconnected pores of 0.4-1.3nm, amorphous activated carbon and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The structures (such as size, shape, volume), connectivity and chemical properties of micropores, play critically important roles in their adsorption and separation capability. The microporous materials with uniform pore structures rather than distribution of a range of pore sizes form a subclass of porous materials, which are known as molecular sieves. Zeolites and MOFs are the best examples of bulk molecular sieve materials, whose diverse properties and applications are well documented. Nonetheless, these bulk molecular sieves are not sufficiently cost-effective. Moreover, their selectivity or permeance is not ideal due to their thickness in the range from tens of nanometers to several micrometers.Recently, atomically thin porous materials have been actively investigated as ultimate thin permeation membranes with fast flow rates. Specifically, graphene and graphene oxides (GOs) are intensively tested for diverse separation applications. In contrast to bulk microporous materials, atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) membranes are more promising due to two important factors. One is the very short distance of permeation transport in the atomic scale. The other is the simplicity of an ideal 2D molecular sieve to separate gas molecules, which is characterized by diffusing energy barriers across the pores, rather than complex mechanisms of the gas molecules adsorption and diffusion through pore channels. Since graphene is not permeable to atoms and molecules except for protons, artificial pores are formed in graphene by focused ion beams, UV-induced oxidation etching or oxygen plasma etching in recent experimental studies. These artificial pores in graphene are distributed over 5-10nm with a peak at 9nm , 0.5-8nm with a peak at 1nm , and ~1nm with irregular shapes. GO laminated 2D membranes also demonstrate superior gas and ion separation performance [,], but they are rather thick (>1.8nm and ~mm) compared with atomically thin graphene membrane. Similar to conventional bulk porous materials, the performance of GO membranes seems to be strongly correlated to their interlayer spacing and chemical composition of oxidized graphene layers. So far, single-layer graphene with artificial pores is the only demonstrated 2D membrane that has been proven to show ideal molecular sieving performance. However, it is classified as 2D porous material rather than 2D molecular sieve due to inherent pore size distribution.As an alternative approach to introduce artificial pores in graphene, chemically modified graphitic structures with precise atomic pores have been theoretically investigated and demonstrated by some experiments. Some graphitic structures such as g-C2O, g-C4N3 and g-C3N3, are theoretically speculated, and other structures like porous graphene (PG), C2N or g-C3N4 are experimentally demonstrated. Nevertheless, these 2D samples of PG and C2N show poor quality in nanoscale domains with slightly small defects of missing atoms. The poor quality of graphitic carbon nitride samples (CnNm) originates from the synthesis methods as well as the intrinsic complexity of CnNm with dozens of compositions ranging from carbon-rich (n/m[?]30) to nitrogen-rich (n/m[?]1/4). Because of these difficulties in preparing high-quality samples, no experimental studies on these modified graphene 2D molecular sieve candidates have been reported. In order to realize 2D molecular sieves, it is desirable to identify layered crystalline structures with intrinsic pores rather than 2D structures with artificial pores because the physical drilling or chemical modification methods are not easily controllable. It is also expected that 2D molecular sieves will have large impacts on numerous applications of gas separation beyond the currently available bulk zeolite and MOF molecular sieves.A series of new layered materials such as metal trihalides MX3 (AsI3, ScI3, SbI3, YI3, BiI3, ScCl3, ScBr3 and YBr3), have been theoretically investigated in our previous work [,]. The MX3 monolayers are thermodynamically stable and feasible to be exfoliated from their corresponding layered bulk materials. According to the chemical formula, MX3 is equivalent to M2/3[?]1/3X2, where the square [?] is missing at the M atom site by removing 1/3 of M atoms in the MX2-type 2D materials. So these 2D structures are featured by precise atomic pores with the pore size in a range of 1.53-1.94A. Compared with traditional membranes with the thickness from tens of nanometers to several micrometers, MX3 monolayers as 2D molecular sieves with the thickness of less than 4A are thin enough to maximize the flux. Herein, the gas separation capability of 2D MX3 molecular sieves has been theoretically demonstrated based on density functional theory (DFT). According to the calculated results such as energy barriers, selectivity and permeance, it can be concluded that 2D MX3 molecular sieves exhibit superior H2/CO and O2/N2 separation performance, which far exceeds those of traditional membrane materials.',\n",
       "  'To search for the transition state (TS) of one gas molecule travelling through the atomic pores of MX3, the optimized configurations of this gas molecule adsorbed on both sides of MX3 were set as the initial state (IS) and final state (FS), respectively. The diffusion energy barrier (E b) is defined as: Eb=ETS-EIS(orEFS) where ETS, EIS and EFS represent the total energies of TS, IS and FS, respectively. The diffusion energy barriers for gas molecules passing through the pores of 2D MX3 molecular sieves are listed in Table S3. Fig. 2 a presents E b for gas molecules travelling through the same X(I)-edged MX3 monolayers. It can be found that the gas molecules are easier to penetrate through 2D MX3 molecular sieves with large pore sizes. Besides the pore size, it is noted that E b is also relevant to the size of gas molecules. The smaller gas molecule often has a smaller E b. For instance, H2 with the smallest size possesses the smallest E b compared with other gas molecules, indicating that H2 could be easily separated from other gas molecules. As shown in Fig. 2a, the energy barrier of H2 passing through 2D MX3 molecular sieves is in a range of ~0.17-0.47eV, which is much smaller than that of other molecules and that of H2 diffusing through polyphenylene (0.61eV) and g-C3N4 (0.75eV). In addition, the bond lengths of gas molecules do not show obvious change during their diffusing processes. In the meanwhile, the charge transfer between the gas molecules and 2D MX3 molecular sieves could be ignored. Thus, the gas molecules would not chemically react with 2D MX3 molecular sieves.The detailed diffusion processes of the gas molecules passing through YBr3 monolayer are taken as representative examples to explore the character of E b, which are demonstrated in Fig. 2b. The energy barrier curves for H2 and NO travelling through YBr3 show double peaks because their mass centers in the TSs are located in the top or bottom halogen atoms plane, as shown in Table S2. In contrast, the mass centers of O2, N2 and CO in the TSs are located within the M atoms plane. The configurations of IS, FS and TS for all the investigated gas molecules passing through 2D MX3 molecular sieves are displayed in Table S2. When the coming gas molecule is not exactly above the pore, it has to move to the positions above the center of the pore in order to penetrate through the pore. Under this situation, the lateral energy difference of gas molecule is required to be considered in addition to the diffusing barrier through the pore. In particular, the lateral energy difference is as small as 0.019-0.026eV for H2, 0.013-0.039eV for CO, 0.027-0.055eV for O2 and 0.028-0.045eV for N2, as shown in Table S1. Therefore, the lateral diffusion would have little influence on the diffusion of the gas molecule, which can be neglected in the following calculation of the permeance.',\n",
       "  \"It is noticed that in the case where the pore size is smaller than the gas molecule size, the transport mechanism of the gas molecule is in an activated regime. In this case, the energy barriers have a relationship with the pore diameters as E b~D c -12 as shown in Fig. 3 a. The pore diameter will change with the flexible variation of M-X bond around the pore edge during the gas molecule transport process. If we select O2 travelling through YBr3 monolayer as an example, the pore diameter of D c '=5.77Aat TS goes larger than the pristine one (D c=5.29A), as shown in Fig. 3c. As the gas molecules pass through 2D MX3 molecular sieves, the halogen atoms around the pores move outward, accompanying with the change of the pore diameters. The atomic pore with three halogen atoms in the top layer and the other three halogen atoms in the bottom layer forms the gas transport channel, as shown in Fig. 4. The width of pore channel at both sides is the same in the pristine state. When a gas molecule approaches the top of MX3 monolayer, the halogen atoms on the top will move outward and provide more space for the gas molecule to get in. As the gas molecule travels further to the center of the pore channel, the bottom halogen atoms also move outward, which results in an increased pore diameter. The gas molecule further gets to the bottom of the pore channel and the top halogen atoms almost return to their original positions. Eventually, the gas molecule passes through the pore channel, and the atomic pore returns back to its pristine state. The variation of the atomic pore behaves like a breathing mode during the gas passage process, which distinguishes 2D MX3 molecular sieve from other one-atom layer porous materials (e.g., PG, C2N or g-C3N4). The pore diameters similarly get larger during the transport processes for all the gas molecules, as shown in Table S4. The change of the pore diameters varies with the different gas molecules travelling through different 2D MX3 molecular sieve. Consequently, not only the pore size but also the gas molecule size influences E b. A smaller difference in size between a molecule and an atomic pore leads to a smaller E b, and there is no obstacle when the pore size is equal to that of the molecular. Quantitatively, the energy barrier (E b) can be fitted with a polynomial dependent on the size difference (Dd), E b=a 1 (Dd)+a 2 (Dd)2+a 3 (Dd)3 + ... As shown in Fig. 3b, when the size difference is less than 1.0A, the quadratic harmonic term plays a major role with a 1=-0.04, a 2=1.76, a 3=-0.27, implying that there is an approximately elastic interaction between the gas molecule and the pore of 2D MX3. When Dd is larger than 1.0A, the high-order term takes a leading role with a 1=0.46, a 2=-0.12, a 3=1.93. Since the interaction between the gas molecule and the pore of 2D MX3 deviates from the elastic region, it becomes more difficult for the gas molecules to pass through the pores with the continuous increase of Dd.\",\n",
       "  \"The selectivity of the target gas (Y) relative to another gas molecule (Z) is a vital parameter to evaluate the separation performance of 2D MX3 molecular sieves. According to the Arrhenius equation, the selectivity is calculated based on the energy barriers of gas molecules passing through monolayer MX3. The selectivity can be defined as: SY/Z=rYrZ=AYexp-(Eb(Y)kBT)AZexp-(Eb(Z)kBT) where r represents the diffusion rate of the gas molecule, and A is the diffusion prefactor. Here the diffusion prefactors are assumed to be identical, e.g. A Y /A Z=1. E b(Y) and E b(Z) represent the energy barriers of the gas molecules Y and Z going through the same molecular sieve, respectively. k B denotes the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. By using 2D MX3 molecular sieves, the selectivity of H2 towards other gases at room temperature is in the range of 102-1015, as shown in Table S5.Besides the selectivity, the permeance is another significant factor to evaluate the separation performance of 2D MX3 molecular sieves. The permeance is calculated as: Q=FDp where Dp is the pressure difference across the 2D molecular sieve, and F represents the molar flux of gas molecules (F=Nxf), respectively. According to the kinetic theory of gases, the molar number of gas molecules arriving at the pores per unit time per unit area can be calculated as: N=ePNAx2pmkBT in which P, N A, m, k B and T represent the gas pressure, the Avogadro constant, the mass of the molecule, the Boltzmann constant and the gas temperature, respectively. e=ApAm denotes a factor, where A p and A m represent the area of pores and membrane, respectively. The probability f of gas particles diffusing through the pore is given by: f=[?]vB[?]f'(v)dv where f'(v) denotes the Maxwell velocity distribution, and v B represents the velocity corresponding to the energy barrier,vB=2Eb/m. An incoming pressure of P=3x105Pa and a pressure difference Dp=1x105Pa were used for the permeance calculation, which are consistent with the previous literatures.An efficient membrane requires to have high selectivity to separate the target gas from gas mixtures, as well as suitable permeance so that the target gas can penetrate. For polymeric membranes, these two factors have a trade-off relationship, which is well known as Robeson's upper bound. Thus, it is important to exploit one membrane with superior selectivity coupled with relatively high permeance that can surpass Robeson's upper bound. Since the permeance-selectivity is subject to the trade-off relationship, the permeance would be sacrificed for the selectivity and vice versa. Fig. 5 shows the selectivity and permeance of 2D MX3 molecular sieves for H2/CO and O2/N2 gas pairs. It can be found that 2D MX3 molecular sieve with a small pore size show better selectivity, which is up to 1015 for H2/CO separation using 2D ScCl3 membrane. Even for YBr3 with a relatively large pore size, the selectivity of H2/CO (~106) is still superior to the experimental data of traditional membranes (~10-103) [,]. The molecular size of H2 (2.50A) is much smaller than that of CO (3.03A), which allows H2 to easily pass through the pores and effectively separate from CO. Considering the selectivity of H2/CO and the permeance of H2, the separation performance of all 2D MX3 molecular sieves surpasses the upper bound line and is comparable to other membrane materials [,,]. Distinguished from the membranes with artificial pores, the realistic 2D molecular sieves of MX3 with natural and uniform size atomic pores in this work could be well utilized to separate H2 within H2/CO gas mixture.The performance of state-of-the-art membranes for O2/N2 separation at room temperature is also provided in Fig. 5b. As shown by blue stars in Fig. 5b, the trade-off relationship on permeance-selectivity of polymeric materials limits the separation performance. To overcome the trade-off relationship, mixed matrix membranes have also been proposed and developed. Nevertheless, the enhancement on the selectivity is still not obvious. Currently, the selectivity of O2/N2 gas pair is as low as ~10 or even less [,]. For instance, the selectivity is 7.45 for ultrathin microporous polymer and 6 for few-layered graphene [,]. Although the molecular sieve of monolayer C2N with atomic pore is similar to 2D MX3, the separation performance data in Fig. 5b is still below the upper bound line according to the theoretically reported energy barriers.It should be noted that the O2/N2 separation performance of 2D MX3 molecular sieves goes far beyond the Robeson's upper bound line. Furthermore, the selectivity is also much higher than any other experimentally or theoretically reported membrane materials. As shown in Fig. 5b, the O2/N2 selectivity of 2D MX3 molecular sieves is as high as 102-104, which is far beyond the selectivity of all existing membranes to a large extent. Taking the permeance-selectivity into account, YBr3, SbI3, YI3 and BiI3 molecular sieves exhibit superior O2/N2 separation performance than AsI3, ScI3, ScCl3 and ScBr3 molecular sieves. Since the relatively lager atomic pore sizes of YBr3, SbI3, YI3 and BiI3 molecular sieves (1.77-1.94A) induce smaller size differences between O2 and the atomic pores, the smaller energy barriers and higher permeance are generated. The selectivity is directly correlated with the energy barrier difference between O2 and N2. The molecule size of O2 (2.90A) is slightly smaller than that of N2 (3.04A), which allows O2 to pass through the pores relatively more easily. In addition to the size difference of gas molecules, the energy barriers are also influenced by the interaction between the gas molecules and 2D molecular sieves. The interaction between N2 molecule and MX3 is slightly larger than that between O2 and MX3, which can be observed from the partial density of states of O2 and N2 passing through monolayer YBr3 in Fig. S2. A relatively large energy barrier difference of 0.14-0.17eV is produced when O2 and N2 travel through 2D YBr3, SbI3, YI3 and BiI3 molecular sieves, comparing with that of monolayer C2N (0.08eV). Consequently, these 2D MX3 molecular sieves demonstrate much higher O2/N2 selectivity. The selectivity of YBr3, SbI3, YI3 and BiI3 molecular sieves is within the range of 102-103, while the higher permeance is also maintained, as shown in Fig. 5b. To the best of our knowledge, no membrane materials reported could achieve such high O2/N2 selectivity combined with superior O2 permeance, indicating the promising applications of 2D MX3 molecular sieves in O2/N2 separation.In terms of practical applications, these MX3 monolayers could be exfoliated from their corresponding bulk materials due to the small cleavage energy (0.11-0.25J/m2) and thermodynamic stability. The exfoliated MX3 monolayers need to combine with conventional porous materials like zeolites, MOFs or polymers as the support. Another point should be noticed that most of MX3 monolayers need to be well engineered in a water-free environment due to their water solubility, similar to the black phosphorus and MOFs. Recently, BiI3 nanoplates have been successfully synthesized in experiments by physical vapor deposition method [,]. Considering the predicted performance of gas separation in Fig. 5, 2D BiI3 molecular sieve might be a suitable candidate to examine O2/N2 or H2/CO separation performance in experiments.\",\n",
       "  'To summarize, we have systematically investigated the performance of gas molecules (H2, O2, NO, CO and N2) diffusing through a series of 2D MX3 molecular sieves with precise atomic pores. The results show that both the sizes of molecules and pores have influence on the passage of gas molecules. Superior separation performance of H2/CO and O2/N2 by 2D molecular sieves MX3 has been discovered, which is far beyond the upper bound line. Remarkably, YBr3, SbI3, YI3 and BiI3 exhibit both high O2/N2 selectivity of 102-103 and relatively high permeance of O2. This superior performance is attributed to the unique atomic pore structures of 2D MX3 and the different interactions between the gas molecules (O2, N2) and 2D MX3 systems. All these findings would provide new insights and possibilities for utilizing the completely realistic and natural 2D molecular sieves for gas separation applications.'],\n",

       " ['A series of new two-dimensional (2D) materials, metal trihalides MX3 (ScCl3, ScBr3, ScI3, YBr3, YI3, AsI3, SbI3, BiI3), have been explored by first-principles calculations. The relatively small cleavage energies compared with that of graphite indicate that monolayers of MX3 can be easily exfoliated from their layered bulk materials. Through electronic structure calculations, we find that monolayer metal trihalides are semiconductors with band gaps ranging from 2.82 eV (SbI3) to 5.47 eV (YBr3). Besides, the monolayers of AsI3, SbI3, and BiI3 display smaller electron effective mass, implying possibly larger electron mobility of these monolayers. Their band edges and band alignments have also been investigated for application in electronic devices. Our findings will expand the frontiers of new 2D materials and new applications for further research.',\n",
       "  'Since the discovery of graphene in 2004, two-dimensional (2D) materials such as hexagonal boron nitride, transition metal oxides, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and metal halogenides have been extensively explored due to their excellent electronic, optical and catalytic properties. To date, tremendous effort has been devoted to searching for new 2D materials, which could be applied in optoelectronics, spintronics, catalysts, chemical and biological sensors, supercapacitors, solar cells, lithium ion batteries, etc. The typical crystal structure of 2D materials has the chemical formula of MX2, such as TMDs, which exhibit various physical properties, i.e., semiconducting, superconducting, metallic state, etc. In the MX2-type 2D materials, M is a metal atom and X is a chalcogen or halogen atom in TMDs and metal halogenides, respectively. For the bulk phases of MX2-type 2D materials, similar to graphite with a stack of graphene layers, they have strong intra-layer covalent bonding and weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions between the inter-layers. Thus, the monolayers could feasibly be exfoliated from the bulk materials. The metallic element M shows +4 valence in TMDs and +2 valence in metal halogenides due to the different oxidation states of the coordinating X atoms, X2- and X-, respectively.Very recently, a novel group of 2D materials with a MX3-type crystal structure has been proposed, which has stimulated great interest in exploring their physical properties. As an example, monolayer bismuth tri-iodide (BiI3) has been theoretically investigated by Ma et al. and Zhang et al. They found that it is feasible to exfoliate monolayer BiI3 from its bulk and the monolayer BiI3 shows strong absorption for visible light. Similar to metal halogenides, M represents the metal element and X represents the halogen element. Different to 2D-MX2 monolayers, the valence state of M in MX3 is +3, not +2, since the oxidation state of the halogen is X- for both compounds. Considering the difference in the cation oxidation states (M3+vs. M2+), one can observe a close relationship between them as MX3 = M2/3#1/3X2, where # is missing at the M atom site. By removing 1/3 of the M atoms in the MX2 monolayer, one can form a monolayer of MX3. These new 2D MX3-type metal trihalides belong to the P1m space group.The bulk structure of metal trihalides MX3 (ScCl3, ScBr3, ScI3, YBr3, YI3, AsI3, SbI3) belongs to the space group R, which is similar to the layered material BiI3. To date, little research has explored the fundamental electronic structure properties of these new monolayer 2D metal trihalides. In this work, we performed first-principles calculations to investigate the electronic structure properties of these monolayer metal trihalides MX3. The cleavage energies of the metal trihalides range from 0.11 to 0.25 J m-2, which are smaller than that of graphite, indicating the feasibility of exfoliating monolayer metal trihalides MX3 from their corresponding layered bulk phases. The electronic structures show that these monolayer metal trihalides MX3 are all semiconducting and the band gap ranges from 2.16 eV (ScI3) to 4.21 eV (YBr3) with PBE and ranges from 2.82 eV (SbI3) to 5.49 eV (YBr3) with the HSE functional. The effective masses were calculated in order to explore the transport properties of these monolayer materials. We find that the electron effective masses of the monolayer metal trihalides AsI3, SbI3, and BiI3 are relatively small, which may result in larger electron mobility facilitating the carrier transport in 2D electronic devices.',\n",
       "  \"Before investigating the properties of the monolayer metal trihalides MX3, we first investigated the feasibility of exfoliating a monolayer from the bulk metal trihalides MX3 by simulating an exfoliation procedure as shown in Fig. 2(a).Three-dimensional (3D) MX3 is stacked with vdW interactions between layers, and a relatively small interlayer vdW interaction makes it feasible to exfoliate single layer MX3. Through introducing a fracture at a selected interlayer in the bulk and gradually increasing the distance between different layers, we can obtain the total energy differences (DE) as a function of (d - d0) shown in Fig. 2(b). DE is defined as the total-energy difference per unit surface area, DE = (E - E0)/S. Here, S is the unit surface area, and E0(E) and d0(d) denote the total energy and distance between the layers in the un-cleaved (cleaved) state, respectively. It is shown that the total energy differences increase with (d - d0) at first due to vdW interaction, and then gradually converge to the cleavage energy. The cleavage energies for ScCl3, ScBr3, ScI3, AsI3, YBr3, YI3, SbI3, and BiI3 are 0.11, 0.16, 0.22, 0.25, 0.15, 0.20, 0.23 and 0.24 J m-2, respectively. These values are smaller compared with the experimentally estimated cleavage energy of graphite (0.36 J m-2), indicating the possibility of exfoliating monolayer metal trihalides MX3 from their layered bulk states. We expect that monolayer MX3 could be obtained for the first time using a similar method to graphene being exfoliated from graphite. Nevertheless, it is noted that all these metal trihalides MX3 are soluble in water. So the preparation process of MX3 needs to be well engineered in a water-free environment. As the vdW interaction between the two layers influences the cleavage energy, the Grimme's DFT-D2 approach was used to include the vdW interactions. To further analyze the cleavage energy, we calculated the atom binding energy (Eb), which is defined as Eb = [2E(M) + 6E(X) - E(MX3)]/8, where E(M), E(X), and E(MX3) are the total energies of the M atom, X atom, and monolayer MX3, respectively. The corresponding binding energies of monolayer MX3 are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, all the binding energies are positive. According to the definition, systems with larger positive Eb possess stronger binding strength. The correlation between the binding energy and the cleavage energy is plotted in the inset of Fig. 2(b), indicating the negative correlation between them. It could be understood that the larger binding energy within the layer would induce the weaker interlayer interaction, corresponding to the decrease in the cleavage energy with the increase in the binding energy. The phonon dispersion calculation further confirmed that the MX3 monolayers are dynamically stable, as shown in the ESI,+ Fig. S1.\",\n",
       "  'Among this series of metal trihalides MX3 (M = Sc, As, Y, Sb, Bi; X = Cl, Br, I), we first present the electronic structures of two typical 2D monolayers, ScI3 and AsI3. Fig. 3(a) and (b) present the band structures of monolayer ScI3 with the PBE and HSE functional, respectively. It is found that the HSE and PBE functional produce quite similar band structures except for the size of the energy gap. The band gap of 3.26 eV with HSE is more accurate than that of 2.18 eV with PBE. From the band structures, it is found that the monolayer ScI3 is an indirect band gap semiconductor. The valence band maximum (VBM) is at the G point, whereas the conduction band minimum (CBM) is at the M point. The band structures of monolayer AsI3 generated by the PBE and HSE methods are plotted in Fig. 3(e) and (f). Similar to ScI3, monolayer AsI3 is also an indirect band gap semiconductor with the gap values of ~2.24 eV via PBE and 2.89 eV via HSE. Different from ScI3, the VBM of AsI3 is located within the G-M line and the CBM is at the G point.In order to provide more references for further study, the optical properties of monolayer ScI3 and AsI3 are also provided in Fig. 3(c), (d), (g) and (h) with different functionals. As we know, the peaks appearing in the imaginary part of the dielectric function e2(o) are directly related to different intra-band or inter-band transitions in the first irreducible Brillouin zone. As confirmed from the figure, the monolayer MX3 shows anisotropic behavior along the x (y) and z axes due to the hexagonal symmetry. The absorption edge locations of e2(o) for monolayer ScI3 and AsI3 are consistent with their band gap values (shown in Table 2) with the PBE and HSE functional. Combined with the analysis of electronic properties, we can also find that the main peaks of e2(o) are contributed by the p-d excitation for monolayer ScI3 from the I-5p states in the valence band to the Sc-3d states in the lowest conduction b, and p-p excitation for monolayer AsI3 from the occupied I-5p states to the unoccupied I-5p and As-4p states. The e2(o) spectra for the PBE functional exhibit similar shapes to those for the HSE functional, except for the absorption edges. The amplitude of the e2(o) spectrum for monolayer AsI3 is higher than that for monolayer ScI3, and the main peaks for monolayer AsI3 are located in the visible light region (1.6-3.2 eV).In addition, the effective masses of ScI3 and AsI3 are deduced in Table 2 as one of the crucial factors to govern the transport properties of semiconductors. Compared with the effective masses of the bulks, the effective masses of the monolayers do not show significant variation with dimension reduction. The electronic structures of all these materials and the imaginary part of the dielectric function e2(o) are also calculated, as shown in the ESI,+ Fig. S2.The effective mass is calculated by the formula based on the parabolic band approximation. All the electron and hole effective masses of monolayer and bulk MX3 are listed in Table 2. From the carrier effective mass outlined in Table 2, it is found that the monolayer AsI3, SbI3, and BiI3 have smaller electron effective masses, suggesting the possibly larger electron mobility provided by the monolayer metal trihalides. There is no obvious difference in the effective masses between the monolayer and their bulks, except that the effective mass of the bulk is twice that of the monolayer for YBr3.To understand the decrease in carrier effective mass for monolayer YBr3 relative to the bulk material, the band structures of the bulk phase and monolayer phase along the high-symmetric directions are displayed in Fig. 4. The bulk YBr3 is an indirect band gap semiconductor with the value of 4.16 eV. The VBM for the bulk YBr3 is located along the G-M line and the CBM is in the K-G direction. We have also performed electronic structure investigations of bilayer and tri-layer YBr3 as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI+) and both of them are indirect band gap semiconductors. Therefore, with the dimension reduction from 3D to 2D, the monolayer YBr3 behaves as a direct band gap semiconductor with the value of 4.20 eV, which is similar to the indirect-direct band gap transition of MoS2. Both the CBM and the VBM are at the M point. The shift of the CBM and VBM in monolayer YBr3 compared to bulk YBr3 influences the electron and hole effective masses. However, when the SOC effect is considered, monolayer YBr3 becomes an indirect band gap semiconductor as the VBM moved to the G point, as shown in Fig. S4(e) (ESI+).All the monolayers of MX3 (M = Sc, As, Y, Sb, Bi; X = Cl, Br, I) have been systematically explored and the band gap values are listed in Table 2. Our results indicate that all monolayer and bulk MX3 materials are indirect band gap semiconductors except for YBr3. These monolayer materials have large band gap values ranging from 2.18 eV (ScI3) to 4.20 eV (YBr3) with the PBE functional and 2.82 eV (SbI3) to 5.47 eV (YBr3) with the HSE functional. In particular, the band gap values are 2.58 eV (PBE) and 3.27 eV (HSE) for monolayer BiI3, which is consistent with previous reports. When the spin-orbital coupling effect (SOC) is included, the band gaps listed in Table 2 vary from 0.08-0.36 eV compared with the GGA results excluding BiI3. The band gap of BiI3 becomes narrower by ~1.0 eV since the stronger SOC effect exists in Bi-6p orbitals. The band structures of all these monolayer and bulk MX3 with SOC are presented in Fig. S5 (ESI+).In order to further investigate the electronic properties of these monolayer metal trihalides, the density of states (DOS) and the partial density of states (PDOS) of these monolayers of MX3 were calculated with the HSE functional and shown in Fig. 5. For the monolayer ScCl3, ScBr3, ScI3, YBr3 and YI3, the M-X bond has an ionic bond character. Their VBMs are mainly contributed by X-p orbitals, and the CBMs are mainly contributed by M-d orbitals. For AsI3, SbI3 and BiI3, the M-X bond shows a covalent bond character. The M-p and X-p orbitals may form bonding and anti-bonding states. Thus, for monolayer AsI3, SbI3, and BiI3, the VBMs are mainly contributed by I-p orbitals, and the CBMs are mainly contributed by the mixture of the M-p and I-p orbitals. We also calculated the DOS and PDOS with the PBE functional, as shown in the ESI,+ Fig. S3. Comparing the PBE and HSE calculations, the DOS plots look similar except for the CBM with the HSE calculation moving toward the higher energy region and thus enlarging the band gap. To gain a deeper insight into the distribution of band-edge electronic states in MX3 materials, the charge density isosurfaces of the VBM and CBM in various MX3 materials, which is consistent with the results of the DOS calculation, were calculated and shown in the ESI,+ Fig. S6.',\n",
       "  'To summarize, we have theoretically investigated the stability and electronic properties of monolayer metal trihalides MX3 (ScCl3, ScBr3, ScI3, YBr3, YI3, AsI3, SbI3, BiI3) through first-principles calculations. The electronic structure properties show that these materials have band gap values ranging from 2.18 eV (ScI3) to 4.20 eV (YBr3) with the PBE functional and from 2.82 eV (SbI3) to 5.47 eV (YBr3) with the HSE functional. The relatively small electron effective masses of monolayer AsI3, SbI3, and BiI3 imply possibly larger electron mobility in these materials. The band edges and band alignments have been calculated for comparison with other 2D materials facilitating their application in vdW heterostruture electronic devices. Our results provide not only guidance for experimental research, but also an insight into various applications of these new 2D materials.'],\n",
       " ['We fabricated and studied perovskite films with two different compositions in this study: 3D CsPbBr2.4Cl0.6 film and 2D-3D mixed CsPbBr3:PEACl film (molar ratio is 1:1 in precursor solution). Details about the film fabrication could be found in the Methods section. Chlorine was added in these films so that both films emit sky-blue light, with photoluminescence (PL) peaks at 486 nm for CsPbBr2.4Cl0.6 film and 487 nm for CsPbBr3:PEACl (1:1) film (Fig.). The corresponding CIE coordinates are (0.06, 0.26) and (0.08, 0.25), respectively (Fig.). Under the ultraviolet (UV) lamp, CsPbBr3:PEACl (1:1) film exhibits much brighter PL emission than the CsPbBr2.4Cl0.6 film (Fig.). Figure shows PLQEs of CsPbBr2.4Cl0.6 film and CsPbBr3:PEACl (1:1) film under different incident laser intensities. Maximum PLQE of CsPbBr3:PEACl (1:1) film (19.8%) is much higher than that of CsPbBr2.4Cl0.6 film (1.1%). Phenylethylammonium halide incorporation in 3D perovskites usually introduces layered phases in the films, which has been demonstrated as an effective method to increase the PLQEs of green perovskite films23,24. Therefore, we focused on CsPbBr3:PEACl (1:1) perovskite in this study because of its higher PLQE compared with 3D CsPbBr2.4Cl0.6 film. PL spectra of perovskite films with different CsPbBr3:PEACl ratios are shown in Supplementary Fig., which shows blue shift of PL peak from 522 nm for CsPbBr3 film to 487 nm for CsPbBr3:PEACl (1:1). Further increasing PEACl ratio in the films to CsPbBr3:PEACl (1:2) results in a much lower PL intensity and very broad emission band with multiple peaks, which might be from self-trapped exciton emission of different layered phases25. X-ray diffraction (XRD) study of the CsPbBr3:PEACl (1:2) film in Supplementary Fig. clearly shows more layered phases are formed with the increased PEACl ratio in the films.The PLQE of 19.8% in CsPbBr3:PEACl (1:1) film still limits the EQE of sky-blue PeLED to be <5%, considering a typical out-coupling efficiency around 20% in perovskite LEDs21. Encouragingly, we found that adding 2% YCl3 in the CsPbBr3:PEACl (1:1) film further increased PLQE to 49.7%, as shown in Fig.. Here, the yttrium ratio is defined as the molar ratio of Y to Pb in the precursor solution. The photographs in Fig. and Supplementary Fig. clearly shows the PEACl:CsPbBr3 (1:1) films with YCl3 have much stronger PL emission than the film without YCl3. The maximum PLQEs of PEACl:CsPbBr3 (1:1) films with 2%, 5%, and 10% YCl3 are 49.7%, 37.9%, and 31.2%, respectively, which are much higher than the film without YCl3. Adding YCl3 in the PEACl:CsPbBr3 (1:1) film also blue shifts the PL peak (Supplementary Fig.). PEACl:CsPbBr3 (1:1) films with 2%, 5%, and 10% YCl3 exhibit PL peak at 485, 483, and 477 nm, respectively. The decreased PLQE in 5% and 10% YCl3 perovskite films compared with 2% YCl3 perovskite film might be caused by the formation of YCl3 clusters, which may hinder perovskite grain growth (Supplementary Fig.). Adding 2% YCl3 in the 3D CsPbBr2.4Cl0.6 film also significantly increases the film PLQE from 1.1% to 8.5%, as shown in Fig.. The photographs in Supplementary Fig. illustrate the PL of CsPbBr3 film was significantly improved by YBr3 treatment.'],\n",
       " ['Intense photoluminescence is reported for hydrated bromides of Gd, La and Y (LaBr3*7H2O, CeBr3*7H2O, YBr3*8H2O and GdBr3*n H2O) prepared by the wet chemical method and activated with Ce3+. Intensities are comparable to that for a commercial phosphor (SrB4O7:Eu2+--Sylvania 2052). Luminescence in hydrated salt is usually quenched. The observation of intense luminescence in hydrated bromides is remarkable.',\n",
       "  \"In the recent years, rare earth bromide crystals have been studied with great interest due to their application as scintillators. CeBr3 as a scintillator was first described by Shah et al. and further developed recently by Guss et al. ; van Loef et al. reported scintillation properties of LaBr3:Ce3+. In the last few years, Cerium doped LaBr3 has received the attention of the scientific community in nuclear spectroscopy because of its 'almost ideal' scintillation properties. Recent studies have shown that LaBr3:Ce scintillators have optimal energy resolution (<3% at 662 keV), an excellent time resolution (~300 ps), good efficiency and a negligible variation of light output within the temperature range -20 to +60 degC. The LaBr3:Ce crystals are commercially available from Saint Gobain Crystals under the brand name BrillanCe 380. The availability of LaBr3:Ce crystals in volumes larger than 1000 cm3 could make these scintillators a possible alternative to HPGe detectors for gamma-ray measurements. In fact, if compared with HPGe, these crystals provide an excellent trade-off between efficiency and energy resolution, with sub-nano second timing. van Loef et al. also reported the scintillation properties of GdBr3:Ce However, it has not received as much attention as LaBr3:Ce due to comparatively lower density and light yield. Though anhydrous YBr3 is not mentioned in ICDD database, theoretical predictions of scintillation properties of YBr3:Ce have been recently made.Growth of single crystals and even the synthesis of the raw materials of these radioluminescent phosphors are difficult, mainly due to their hygroscopic nature. Rare earth bromides exist in a variety of hydrated forms. Lanthanum and Cerium bromides exist as heptahydrates (REBr3*7H2O), hexahydrates (REBr3*6H2O are known for RE=Pr, Nd, Dy, Eu) and octahydrates (REBr3*8H2O where, RE=Ho, Er and Y). When the raw materials are prepared by wet chemical methods, hydrated salts are expected. Heating in air invariably results in contamination by oxybromides and anhydrous salts can be obtained only by careful heating in high vacuum/argon atmosphere. No information is available on the luminescence of Ce3+ in the hydrated RE bromides. We prepared such bromides by wet chemical methods and observed very intense photoluminescence (PL). The results are reported in this paper.\",\n",
       "  \"YBr3*8H2O crystallizes in monoclinic space group P21/n. Anhydrous YBr3 is not mentioned in the ICDD database. However, scintillation properties of Ce3+ activated yttrium halides have been theoretically predicted. No experimental measurements are available. The results presented below are perhaps the first report on Ce3+ emission in YBr3*8H2O. Emission spectrum of YBr3*8H2O containing 0.1 mol% Ce3+ ( Fig. 4, curve a) consists of a typical double humped band with maxima at 337.6 and 358.8 nm. There is also a hint of a shoulder around 330 nm. In the excitation curve (Fig. 4, curve c), three distinct bands can be observed around 235.4, 251.4 and 314.4 nm. The excitation and emission maxima shift marginally to longer wavelengths for higher concentrations (Fig. 4, curves b and d).PL data for Ce3+ emission obtained in this work are summarized in Table 1. Redshift values are in a relatively narrow range of 21,000-24000 cm-1. This is consistent with the observation of Dorenbos who tabulated data for a large number of compounds including some bromides. The spread in Stokes shift values is much more profound. Tabulated data for bromides show the same to vary between 1900 and 3500 cm-1. For all the hydrated bromides prepared in this study, the Stokes shift is much less and confined to the range 1600-2200 cm-1. Quite small Stokes shifts are obtained for CeBr3*7H2O and GdBr3*nH2O.Very intense PL emission is thus observed in all the hydrated RE bromides. This is perhaps the first observation of this kind. We could get only one reference on PL in stoichiometric hydrated bromides NdBr3*6H2O and EuBr3*6H2O. To get the idea about the intensity, PL emission of a commercial lamp phosphor (Sylvania 2052, fine powder, SrB4O7:Eu2+) is shown along with various RE bromides plotted on the same scale ( Fig. 5). It is seen that if the area under the emission curve is considered, the emission intensity for most of the bromides prepared in this work is comparable or even more than that for SrB4O7:Eu2+. Efficient PL in the solids containing water of crystallization is considered exceptional. Vibrational levels of H2O usually provide non-radiative paths and quench the emission. At low temperatures, emission modified by vibrational levels may be observed only in a few cases. Ce3+ emission, on the other h, is in the UV region and the energy is perhaps too high to be dissipated non-radiatively. Another possible explanation is that the energy transfer from Ce3+ takes place over short distances. In hydrated bromides, there may not be effective energy transfer from Ce3+ to H2O molecules. Crystals of hydrated solids have not been previously considered in scintillation applications. In light of intense PL emission, efficient scintillation in Ce3+ activated bromides cannot be ruled out 'a priori'. It may prove simpler to obtain transparent blocks of the hydrated salts in comparison to the growth of the large single crystals of anhydrous bromides. Discovery of intense luminescence in hydrated RE bromides certainly opens up several exciting possibilities.\"]]"
