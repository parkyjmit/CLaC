       "'Development of a used fuel cladding damage model incorporating circumferential and radial hydride responses\\nABSTRACT\\nAt the completion of the fuel drying process, used fuel Zry4 cladding typically exhibits a significant population of δ -hydride inclusions. These inclusions are in the form of small platelets that are generally oriented both circumferentially and radially within the cladding material. There is concern that radially-oriented hydride inclusions may weaken the cladding material and lead to issues during used fuel storage and transportation processes. A high fidelity model of the mechanical behavior of hydrides has utility in both designing fuel cladding to be more resistant to this hydride-induced weakening and also in suggesting modifications to drying, storage, and transport operations to reduce the impact of hydride formation and/or the avoidance of loading scenarios that could overly stress the radial inclusions.We develop a mechanical model for the Zry4-hydride system that, given a particular morphology of hydride inclusions, allows the calculation of the response of the hydrided cladding under various loading scenarios. The model treats the Zry4 matrix material as J2 elastoplastic, and treats the hydrides as platelets oriented in predefined directions (e.g., circumferentially and radially). The model is hosted by the Albany analysis framework, where a finite element approximation of the weak form of the cladding boundary value problem is solved using a preconditioned Newton–Krylov approach. Instead of forming the required system Jacobian operator directly or approximating its action with a differencing operation, Albany leverages the Trilinos Sacado package to form the Jacobian via automatic differentiation. We present results that describe the performance of the model in comparison with as-fabricated Zry4 as well as HB Robinson fuel cladding. Further, we also present performance results that demonstrate the efficacy of the overall solution method employed to host the model.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThere are numerous processes that can potentially impact fuel handling after the drying and long term storage of used nuclear fuel. Cladding damage can occur throughout the life of the fuel; this damage might affect the retrieval of the fuel assemblies from the storage and transport casks given a loading event of sufficient intensity. As discussed in an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) summary article [27], the formation of radial hydrides in the cladding during drying may be one of the more important processes to consider. Further, as fuel storage is a recent endeavor, it is not possible to experimentally examine fuel after a period of long term storage. Thus, computational investigation of the impact of hydriding may be uniquely suited to best understanding the phenomena.During reactor operation, water coolant is in continual contact with the Zircaloy (Zry4) fuel cladding under elevated temperatures and pressures in a pressurized water reactor (PWR). A small amount of water decomposes, the disassociated oxygen attacks the outside surface of the Zry4 to form an oxide layer that is typically less than 100\\xa0μm thick (c.f. Fig. 2-2 in [27]). Some of the hydrogen goes into solid solution within the Zry4, the amount of which depends on the Zry4 temperature and the diffusion rate. There is often a gradient in the amount of hydrogen in solution, the amount typically decreases with distance from the coolant. Thus, the amount of hydrogen contained in Zry4 is typically discussed in terms of maximum wall thickness average (MWTA) values that tend to increase with burnup (c.f. Fig. 2-3 in [27]).The solubility of hydrogen in Zry4 increases with temperature [7]. Discharged high-burnup cladding can contain up to 800\\xa0ppm hydrogen, some of which is typically precipitated as circumferentially oriented hydride platelets located in a rim near the outer surface of the fuel (when examined at room-temperature). During drying processes (held to a maximum of 400\\xa0°C peak fuel temperature), there is roughly 200\\xa0ppm of hydrogen in solution in the Zry4 that is available for precipitation as a radial hydride given an appropriate hoop stress. The cooling strategy following the peak drying temperature appears to affect the formation of radial hydrides. Hong and Lee [17] show that holding an applied hoop stress load at 300\\xa0°C for 7\\xa0h prior to cooling promoted extensive formation of radial hydrides.Fig. 2–5 in [27] develops a description of the cooling rate for fuel in traditional storage,equation (1 )T(K)=517.48+155.52exp(-0.0877t)-0.6922575t.Such curves are constructed by considering a hypothetical fuel rod within a cask [13]\\xa0and\\xa0 [28], consisting of an idealized heat transfer calculation where the thermal conductivity in the fuel and cladding is used to approximate the heat flux through these components to calculate an effective thermal conductivity of the cask and cask environment. A source term is used to generate the decay heat in the fuel. Fig. 5-1 in [28] shows a fit to the decay power (in Watts per assembly) over a 30\\xa0year storage history. The cask, remainder of the assembly, and the inert gas surrounding the fuel rod are modeled using an effective heat conduction value representative of the homogenized materials. The outer boundary of the cask is assumed to maintain a fixed temperature that is taken to be the maximum temperature seen in the surrounding storage environment (typically 40\\xa0°C).The thermal conductivities of both irradiated fuel and cladding are well characterized. One may calculate a homogenized overall conductivity value by noting that the fuel temperature is limited to 400\\xa0°C during drying. Given the decay heat of the fuel, this maximum fuel temperature, the conductivities of the fuel and the clad, and the outside temperature of the cask, one may calculate an effective thermal conductivity for the environment such that the maximum fuel temperature is not exceeded during drying. Employing the resultant conductivity during the entire storage period results in a fuel temperature description Eq. (1). Note that this approach overpredicts the fuel temperature during storage, as the post-drying storage cask environment would transfer heat significantly more effectively than the partial vacuum present during drying. Fig. 1 attempts to approximate the increased conductivity of the helium-filled cask environment at one atmosphere backfill pressure.Once the thermal profiles of the irradiated fuel and cladding are obtained, one can then estimate the hydride concentration and morphology. To investigate the mechanical response, it is then necessary to develop a mechanical model that describes the hydrided materials when they are subjected to loading. A series of EPRI reports [27], [30]\\xa0and\\xa0[29], as well as [31], consider a damage-based multi-phase metal/hydride mixture model. The model is based on the cladding being composed of volume fractions of four distinct components; base undamaged Zry4 metal, damaged (cracked) Zry4 metal, undamaged hydride platelet material, and damaged (cracked) hydride platelet material. In [11], the hydrided material is modeled using an anisotropic Gurson model, where the effect of hydrides is incorporated with a damage parameter that considers the behavior of the hydride inclusions in the material. In [36], an analytical model is proposed for calculating a criterion for crack growth in hydrided materials.The mechanical model proposed in this paper explicitly considers the Zry4 matrix containing multiple hydride inclusions. Unlike previous work, the current model begins with a single stored strain-energy for the hydrided material, where the stress response is derived in a thermodynamically consistent manner, that results in a large deformation hyperelasto-plastic framework. The Zry4 matrix is modeled as an elastoplastic material, while the hydrides are represented as inclusions with preferred directions. The model has the flexibility to specify the volume fraction and damage evolution for each hydride inclusion. In this study, the volume fractions of the radial (fr) and circumferential (fc) hydride phases are specified independently, from an estimate of the general morphology of the specimen. For both orientation, the volume fractions are typically given in parts per million (ppm). The volume fraction of the matrix material is then fm=1.0-fc-fr .The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the formulation for the underlying nonlinear boundary value problem that is the basis of the study, Section 3 presents some background information concerning finite deformation elastoplasticity, Section 4 details the model formulation, Section 5 addresses implementation issues, Section 6 presents benchmark cases where analytical solutions are used to verify model implementation, and finally Section 7 presents numerical examples and compares numerical simulations with available experimental data.\\nNONLINEAR BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEM IN ELASTOPLASTICITY\\nThis investigation begins by deriving a nonlinear elastoplasticity boundary value problem. We consider an elastoplastic body occupying a region D∈R3 in the reference configuration with a boundary S=∂D . The boundary is assumed to admit the partitioning S=Sφ∪ST , where Sφ∩ST=0 , and Sφ and ST correspond to Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries, respectively. Material points in the reference configuration are labeled by their position vector X . A deformation, φ:D→R3 , is defined as an injective mapping that establishes a spatial, or deformed, configuration where material points have the new position vector x=φ(X) . The gradient of the deformation mapping F=∂φ(X)/∂X , is termed the deformation gradient. We further assume there exists a functional I[φ] known as the potential energy of the elastoplastic body, defined asequation (2 )I[φ]=∫D[W(F)-RBiφi]dV-∫STT‾iφidS,where W(F) refers to the strain energy density of the body, Bi is the body force vector per unit mass, R \\xa0 is the material density in the reference configuration and T‾i is the prescribed traction on the Neumann boundary. Taking variations of this functional yields the standard Euler–Lagrange equations corresponding to the strong form of the static elastoplastic governing equationsequation (3 )DivP+RB=0inD,φ=φ¯onSφ,PN=T¯onST.Here, P=∂W(F)/∂F is the first Piola–Kirchhoff stress, and N refers to the normal to the boundary in the reference configuration.\\nKINEMATIC PRELIMINARIES FOR FINITE DEFORMATION ELASTOPLASTICITY\\nTo set the stage for the proposed material model, the kinematic preliminaries for finite deformation elastoplasticity are summarized in this section, along with the quantities and relations used in subsequent model development.An essential feature of this elastoplasticity framework is the multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradient F into an elastic part Fe and a plastic part Fpequation (4 )F=FeFp.This decomposition introduces the notion of an intermediate local configuration ( c.f. ( [35]) and the references therein for the motivation and micromechanical basis for such a decomposition).Next, we introduce a set of strain measures associated with the multiplicative decomposition that will be used extensively in the model development. First is the right Cauchy–Green tensor C , and its plastic counterpart Cp , which are defined in the reference configurationequation (5 )C=FTF,equation (6 )Cp=FpTFp.In the current configuration we consider the left Cauchy–Green tensor b , and its elastic counterpart beequation (7 )b=FFT,equation (8 )be=FeFeT.The above fundamental strain measures are related via pull-back and push-forward operationsequation (10 )C-p=F-1beF-T,be=FC-pFT.In metal plasticity, a standard assumption is that plastic flow is isochoric (volume-preserving), i.e., \\xa0 det(Fp)=1 , which impliesequation (11 )J=det(F)=det(Fe).Defining Je=det(Fe) , we have the volume preserving part of the elastic left Cauchy–Green tensor b¯eequation (12 )b¯e=Je-2/3be=J-2/3be.Furthermore, we introduce principal invariants of the right Cauchy–Green tensorequation (13 )I1=tr(C),equation (14 )I2=12[(tr(C)2-tr(C2)],equation (15 )I3=det(C).For isotropic materials, the stored strain-energy function typically depends on C through these three principal invariants. However, due to the presence of the embedded radial and circumferential hydrides in the cladding material, a fourth invariant associated with the hydride direction must be included. Denoting M as the unit direction vector associated with the hydride orientation, the fourth invariant I4 can be defined as ( [15])equation (16 )I4=M·C·M,where ‘ · ’ denotes the dot product, i.e., \\xa0 in indicial notation M·C=MiCij . Defined in this way, the invariant I4 has a direct interpretation as the square of the stretch in the direction of the hydride orientation under consideration.\\nFORMULATION OF THE FINITE DEFORMATION ZRY4-HYDRIDE DAMAGE MODEL\\nIn this section, a Zry4-hydride damage model is developed to model the mechanical response of the cladding material with multiple preferred hydride directions. The model treats the Zry4 matrix as a J2 elasto-plastic material, and treats the hydrides as nonlinear elastic brittle material with damage and preferred directions (e.g., the circumferential and radial directions). A single stored strain-energy function is proposed for the Zry4-hydride system, with contributions from both matrix and hydrides, which fits nicely into the nonlinear boundary value problem formulation presented in Section 2. The directional dependence of the hydrides is incorporated through the previously introduced I4 in Eq. (16). The stress response of the material is then derived from the energy function, in a thermo-dynamically consistent manner.\\nSTRAIN-ENERGY FUNCTION FOR CLADDING MATERIAL WITH MULTIPLE PREFERRED HYDRIDE DIRECTIONS\\nIn Eq. (2), the strain energy density function W(F) is written in terms of deformation gradient F . Equivalently, it can be written in terms of right Cauchy–Green tensor, i.e., \\xa0 Ψ(C)=W(F) . In this work, the strain-energy function is assumed to have the following formequation (17 )Ψ(C)=fm(1-ξm)Ψm0(C)+∑infi(1-ξi)Ψi0(C,Mi),where C is the right Cauchy–Green tensor, M is the unit vector normal to the hydride plane, Ψ0 is the strain-energy function for undamaged material, f \\xa0 is the volume fraction, ξ is a scalar damage parameter, and n \\xa0 is the number of preferred hydride directions. For systems with only circumferential and radial hydrides, n=2 . Subscripts m and i denote the matrix and ith hydride inclusion, respectively.The volume fraction obeys the partition of unity propertyequation (18 )fm+∑infi=1.It is clear that the strain-energy function consists of contributions from both the Zry4 matrix and hydrides. Use of a component-specific damage parameter and volume fraction adds flexibility to the model to capture a variety of hydride compositions. The next step is to properly select strain-energy functions for different materials.For the Zry4 matrix, we propose to use a J2 type strain-energy function, commonly used for modeling elastoplastic behavior in metals with isochoric plastic flow behavior [35]equation (19 )Ψm0=U(J)+W(b¯e),where U(J) and W(b¯e) are the volumetric and deviatoric part of the strain energy with the following formsequation (20 )U(J)=κ212(J2-1)-log(J),W(b¯e)=μ2(tr(b¯e)-3).Here, κ and μ are the bulk and shear modulus for the Zry4 matrix, respectively.The hydride components endow the material with one or more preferential directions, which may be described by a unit vector M . Using Eq. (16), we refer to I4(i) as the invariant for the i \\xa0th hydride and write the strain energy as a function of C and I4(i) . Then, the strain-energy function for the hydrides will be independent of the sign choice for M , i.e., \\xa0 Ψi0(C,M)=Ψi0(C,-M) . The strain-energy function still depends on M but only through the invariant I4(i) . One particular form of strain-energy function, similar to those used to model fibers in composite materials ([15]) is proposed hereequation (21 )Ψi0=kiqi{exp[qi(I4(i)-1)2]-1},where ki and qi are two material constants for the ith hydride.Remark\\xa01.The above model development is based on the notion of a hyperelastic constitutive relation, i.e., there exists a stored strain-energy function from which the constitutive or stress response of the material can be derived. Such a hyperelastic constitutive relation is particularly suitable for problems where the governing equations are derived from a single energy functional, e.g., Eq. (2), using a variational principle.Remark\\xa02.It should be emphasized that the specific energy functions proposed in this section are intended to capture some of the most salient features of the Zry4-hydride cladding materials of interest. However, the strain-energy functions are by no means universal. Calibration for material parameters are needed, as for any material model. Given sufficient available experimental data, different strain-energy functions may be used as desired.\\nELASTIC CONSTITUTIVE LAW AND STRESS\\nUsing the strain-energy function as proposed in Eqs. (17), (19)\\xa0and\\xa0(21), it is straightforward to derive the elastic constitutive law and the stresses by taking derivatives of the strain-energy functions with respect to corresponding strain measures. For the Zry4 matrix material, the Kirchhoff stress tensor is obtained by the general expressionequation (22 )τ0=2Fe∂Ψm0∂CeFeT=JU′(J)1+s.Substituting the J2 -type energy form Ψm0 from Eq. (19), the Kirchhoff stress tensor without damage isequation (23 )τ0=Jp1+s,equation (24 )p=U′(J)=κ2(J-1/J),equation (25 )s=dev(τ)=μdev(b¯e).In engineering applications, the Cauchy stress tensor is typically used. For the matrix, the Cauchy stress considering damage is expressed asequation (26 )σm=(1-ξm)σ0=(1-ξm)τ0/J.For the stress in the platelets, the 2nd Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor for the ith hydride without damage isequation (27 )Si0=2∂Ψi0∂C=4ki(I4(i)-1)exp[qi(I4(i)-1)2](Mi⊗Mi).Then, considering damage, the Cauchy stress tensor for the ith hydride isequation (28 )σi=(1-ξi)(F·Si0·F)/J.Following the uncoupled strain energy function in Eq. (17), the total Cauchy stress of the Zry4-hydride system is the accumulation of the contributions of the different components,equation (29 )σ=fmσm+∑infiσi.\\nYIELD FUNCTION AND HARDENING LAW FOR THE ZRY4 MATRIX\\nThe stress in the Zry4 matrix is restricted by the yielding condition, Φ(τ,εp)⩽0 , where Φ(τ,εp) is the yield function. Following ([35]), the J2 -type yield function can be written asequation (30 )Φ(τ,α)=‖s‖-23[Y0+H(εp)],where s=dev(τ) is the deviatoric stress tensor, Y0 is the initial yield strength, and H(εp) is the hardening function that depends on the internal variable ( e.g., \\xa0 the equivalent plastic strain εp ).Different forms of hardening functions can be used, here we adopt a saturation-type nonlinear hardening functionequation (31 )H(εp)=Kεp+Y∞[1-exp(-δεp)],where K \\xa0 is the hardening modulus, Y∞ is the residual strength, and δ is the saturation exponent.\\nDAMAGE EVOLUTION LAWS\\nFor the scalar damage variable ξ appearing in the strain-energy function Eq. (17), one phenomenological evolution law ([16]) isequation (32 )ξ(α)=ξ∞[1-exp(-α/τ)],where ξ∞ describes the dimensionless maximum damage and τ corresponds to the damage saturation parameter. α is identified in ( [16]) as the maximum thermodynamic force. For each phase of the material, i.e., each of the Zry4 matrix and hydrides, there will be a different set of parameters for damage evolution.Remark\\xa03.It should be pointed out that the damage parameter (ξ) introduced in Eq. (17) and its evolution defined in Eq. (32) governs the degradation in energy of (and consequently the stress in) the Zry4-hydride system due to the hydride-induced weakening. It is a phenomenological parameter for the continuum mechanical model that represents the cumulative effects from micro-structural defects and fracture processes.\\nMODEL IMPLEMENTATION AND SOLUTION PROCEDURE\\nThe proposed hydride model was implemented in Sandia National Laboratories’ Albany analysis code [34]\\xa0and\\xa0[33]. The code is designed for the rapid development of finite-element analysis capabilities enabled through the concept of agile components; generic building blocks of capabilities are readily assembled to meet the requirements of the ultimate analysis application. Genericism is provided by the use of template-based generic programming (TBGP) techniques [21]\\xa0and\\xa0[22], where the code’s components are implemented to operate on general template data types which are specialized at compile time to deliver the desired capabilities. To provide the latest in solution and preconditioning technologies as well as fundamental simulation capabilities, Albany heavily leverages the Trilinos multiphysics framework. As an outcome of this overall design, Albany has a unique infrastructure that limits the need for programming to simply writing the physics residual equations based a generic type. Albany will then compute the system Jacobian and preconditioner for the Newton nonlinear solver, as well as provide sensitivity and uncertainty information about the simulation and selected input and model parameters through the use of embedded uncertainty quantification [24]\\xa0and\\xa0[25]. Lastly, both Albany [33] and Trilinos [14] are openly available at the download sites given in the bibliography.Newton-based nonlinear solution approaches are becoming popular for nuclear applications due to their strong convergence and robustness characteristics, and ease of implementation in software [8], [9], [12]\\xa0and\\xa0[20]. To apply a Newton solver to the present problem, one writes the weak form of the elastoplastic governing Eq. (3) in residual form [20]equation (33 )F(x)=0.F is a system of nonlinear algebraic equations of length N \\xa0, the number of unknowns in the discrete problem. The system Jacobian is an N×N sparse matrixequation (34 )J(x)=∂F(x)∂x.Given the system Jacobian and residual functions, it is straightforward to express the Newton iteration,equation (35 )J(x(k))δx(k)=-F(x(k)),where the state is advanced using an expression of the formequation (36 )x(k+1)←x(k)+δx(k).In lieu of Eq. (36), sophisticated line search methods to advance the problem state are typically used in application codes like Albany. It is customary to employ strategies that eliminate non-physical values within the iteration and to use search methods that improve the overall nonlinear convergence properties of the solution method.Conditioning of the resultant linear problem is usually important to the overall performance of a Newton-based solution method. To motivate this statement, note that at each iteration level k, Eq. (35) describes a linear system that must be solved to obtain the Newton state update vector δx . In this case,equation (37 )Aδx=b,where A is the coefficient matrix obtained from evaluating the Jacobian operator at the current state x(k) , and b is the negated value of the system residual also evaluated at the current state. For efficiency and to provide the desired parallel performance, one often solves the linear system of Eq. (37) using an iterative approach, likely using an iterative solver that employs a Krylov subspace search algorithm. While these solvers often provide the best performance, the convergence behavior of such algorithms is tied to the conditioning of the linear operator A ; if A is poorly-conditioned, one may mitigate this by pre- or post-multiplying the operator by a preconditioner \\xa0 P-1 , that is typically viewed as some approximate inverse of A , to make the overall linear system easier to solve. In the case of left preconditioning, one obtains the final linear system,equation (38 )P-1Aδx=P-1b.One perceived disadvantage to the use of preconditioned Newton solution methods concerns the need to form the Jacobian operator for the solution process, and to form an approximate Jacobian for preconditioning purposes. There are four general approaches to obtaining a Jacobian operator. First, one can form and code the Jacobian analytically for use in both the Newton solver and as input to a preconditioning operation. Most application codes would like to avoid this approach as it is typically a tedious, detail-oriented process that must be repeated every time the physics equations of interest are modified. Secondly, one can form an approximate Jacobian matrix by forming the derivatives numerically (via finite differencing), and storing the derivatives in matrix form. This method is computationally expensive due the number of differencing operations needed, but it is generally applicable. The differencing operations typically scale well in parallel, which partially amortizes the cost of the approach.A third approach, termed the “Jacobian-free Newton Krylov” (JFNK) algorithm, is tied to the use of an iterative Krylov subspace linear solver. The approach employs a finite-differencing operation to approximate the Jacobian-vector product that appears inside the Krylov linear solver. Here, the system residual function is repeatedly called with an ∊ -perturbed state to provide the action of the Jacobian. Preconditioning is generally needed for acceptable linear convergence behavior and is usually mandatory for more complex problems such as cladding model developed here. Preconditioning is even more important when JFNK is used as a solution method as the action of the Jacobian (Jv) is formed via differencing each linear solver iteration, which forces one to limit the number of linear iterations per Newton iteration to a small value for efficiency. While the general requirement of effective preconditioning for the successful use of JFNK is well documented in the literature [4]\\xa0and\\xa0[18]; this limitation will be directly examined in this paper using the proposed cladding model. Finally, both JFNK and finite differencing use a numerical ∊ to form the required numerical derivatives. While good strategies exist for the selection of ∊ , this is an additional complication shared by these approaches.The fourth approach, also supported in the Albany code, is the use of automatic differentiation to form the system Jacobian [1], [2]\\xa0and\\xa0[26]. This method is implemented using the Sacado package in Trilinos. Sacado hosts a collection of automatic differentiation data types that can serve as the template argument of the Newton residual function. When the residual function templated on the scalar (double) data type is evaluated by Albany, the system residual vector is the evaluated outcome. When Albany evaluates the residual vector templated on a Sacado forward auto differentiation (FAD) type, the system Jacobian is calculated. In essence, this approach provides the analytic Jacobian “automatically.” Indeed, given the generic residual function, the developer need not write any code to form derivatives for the Jacobian, sensitivity analysis, optimization, or uncertainty quantification operations performed within the code.\\nBENCHMARK ELEMENT TESTS\\nThe purpose of benchmark element tests are twofold, (i) to verify the numerical implementation of the Zry4-hydride model and (ii) to analyze the directional dependence of the mechanical response of the model. Three element tests are considered, uniaxial tension, simple shear, and hydrostatic tension, as shown in Fig. 2. For simplicity, we consider only a single hydride inclusion. In each of the loading tests, we vary the direction of the inclusion. The angle of the hydride with respect to the x1 direction is marked as θ in Fig. 2.Material properties for matrix material are: Young’s modulus E=98.0×103 \\xa0MPa and Poisson’s ratio ν=0.37 . Matrix hardening parameters (c.f. Eqs. (30)\\xa0and\\xa0(31)) are: K\\xa0=\\xa0500\\xa0MPa, Y0=1267 \\xa0MPa, Y∞=500 \\xa0MPa, and δm=46 . Matrix damage parameters are τm=0.001 and ξ∞(m)=1.0 . Material parameters for the hydride inclusions are: k=1.0×103 \\xa0MPa, q=0.1 , volume fraction f=0.2 . Finally, damage parameters are τi=400.0 and ξ∞(i)=1.0 .Analytical expressions for hydride energy and stress can be developed for the above single element testsequation (39 )Ψi=(1-ξi)kq{exp[q(I4-1)2]-1},equation (40 )Si=(1-ξi)4k(I4-1)exp[q(I4-1)2](M⊗M),where I4 is a function of fiber direction vector M (Eq. (16)), and M={cos(θ),sin(θ),0} . ξi is the damage term given in Eq. (32).Fig. 3 compares the stress in a hydride inclusion vs. the imposed deformation for a given hydride direction of θ=60° . The model implementation reproduces the analytical expression exactly. The softening responses seen in all three cases are due to the damage terms introduced into the material model.To illustrate the directional dependence of the mechanical response of the model, Fig. 4 shows the energy in the hydride as a function of orientation at a given value of deformation. Note that the model predicts a strong directional dependency in the response as a function of hydride orientation. For the uniaxial test, the energy in the hydride is symmetric with respect to the θ=90° plane, where a minimum results. At this angle, the hydride is perpendicular to the loading direction. For the simple shear test, the symmetry in energy no longer exists for the range of hydride directions considered (0–180°) due to the loss of symmetry in the invariant I4 . In the case of the hydrostatic tension test, there is no directional dependency. This is because the element is uniformly stretched in all directions in this test, hence there is no difference in how the hydride is oriented. Again, for all three cases considered, the implementation recovers the analytical solution exactly.\\nMODEL CALIBRATION AND NUMERICAL EXAMPLES\\nIn this section, we present a uniaxial tension test on as-fabricated (AF) Zry4 and a ring compression test on HB Robinson (HBR) fuel materials using the Zry4-hydride model. Our objective is to calibrate the hydride model with available experimental data, compare the simulation with experimental results, and examine the numerical performance and convergence characteristics of the model implementation. Most of the experimental data used in this section are from tests performed at Argonne National Laboratory [3], [5]\\xa0and\\xa0[6].\\nUNIAXIAL TENSION TEST ON AF FUEL SAMPLES\\nThe purpose of this uniaixal tension test is twofold, (i) to calibrate material parameters, in particular, plasticity parameters of the Zry4 matrix to compare with AF Zry4 data given in Fig. 2(a) of [6]; and (ii) to analyze the computational performance and numerical convergence characteristics of the model implementation. The experimental data that was used are from a displacement-controlled axial tensile test on AF Zry4 samples with both double and single machined gauge sections. Due to symmetry, only a single gauge needs to be meshed as shown in Fig. 5.Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the calibrated Zry4-hydride model with the unirradiated Zry4 at 26°C curve from Fig. 2(a) of [6]. An excellent match was obtained between the experimental data and the model calculation. The calibrated parameters are listed in Table 1.\\nCOMPUTATIONAL PERFORMANCE OF THE MODEL\\nThe model was developed within the Albany analysis code [34]. As the weak form of the boundary value problem Eq. (3) yields a nonlinear problem, a Newton solution approach was used to solve for the displacements, the plastic part of the deformation tensor, the equivalent plastic strain, etc. As introduced in Section 5, there are multiple strategies in the use of a Newton solver for analysis applications. To support this hydride model development, we considered both Newton’s method using a Jacobian formed using automatic differentiation using the Trilinos Sacado package (automatic differentiated Jacobian, ADJ), and a Jacobian-free Newton Krylov (JFNK) approach. We used a preconditioned GMRES solver (from the Trilinos Belos package) for the linear solver for all results presented.Given the importance of preconditioning in advanced analysis applications such as presented here, this study briefly considers two modern multilevel preconditioning strategies in comparison with a reference preconditioner, an incomplete LU factorization (ILU) of the system Jacobian matrix. The first involves a splitting of the approximate Jacobian using a block Gauss/Seidel (BGS) approach followed by either applying algebraic multigrid (AMG) or a direct solver to each block, and the second involves directly applying AMG to the approximate Jacobian.The BGS approach may be viewed as a matrix splitting, where the linear operator is composed of three components,equation (41 )A=L+D+U.A Gauss–Seidel preconditioner is an approximate inversion approach that supplies a preconditioner derived from the diagonal and lower triangular parts of the matrix,equation (42 )P-1=(D+L)-1.The block version employed here is based on the use of the Trilinos Teko physics-based preconditioner package to split the matrix giving blocks that correspond to the x,y , and z displacement equations, and then applying either AMG or a direct solver to obtain an inverse of each block.Use of AMG provides a multilevel preconditioner in its own right due to the refinement and coarsening operations that it employs internally. We chose to consider the approach here as AMG employing smoothed aggregation can be quite effective on problems where the (near) null-space (e.g., rigid body motions) is well understood [19]. Internally, Albany supplies configuration information about the rigid body modes to the Trilinos ML package, that implements the AMG technique.Specifically, the four different preconditioners considered were:•BGS/D: block Gauss–Seidel using a direct solver (Trilinos Amesos package) on each block,•BGS/ML: block Gauss–Seidel using algebraic multigrid (Trilinos ML package [10]) on each block,•ILU (1): incomplete factorization with one level of fill and two levels of overlap (Trilinos Ifpack package), and•ML: algebraic multigrid (Trilinos ML package).Table 2 shows the performance of the solvers considered for this hydride model on the uniaxial tension calculations, in terms of the overall simulation time (wall clock).The first two rows of the table compare the ADJ approach with JFNK, using a block Gauss–Siedel preconditioner applying algebraic multigrid as a block solver (BGS/ML). In the first row, the Sacado automatic differentiation package is used to fill the Jacobian “analytically;” this Jacobian is also input to the BGS/ML preconditioner for approximate inversion before being used in the GMRES solver. For the JFNK approach, the action of the Jacobian is developed using finite-differencing within the linear solver. However, JFNK must typically be preconditioned for performance. For simplicity and to support side-by-side comparison, we supplied the “analytic Jacobian” (calculated using Sacado) to the approximate inversion routines for both approaches. We wish to stress that such an approach would not be employed in practice, as there is little reason to use a Jacobian-free solver if one has a Jacobian available.In Table 2, the columns correspond to:1.The cumulative CPU time required to fill the Jacobian matrix. In the case of the ADJ method, this value is essentially counted twice as both the Jacobian and preconditioner matrix must be filled, and they are not the same when a block Gauss–Seidel preconditioning operation is employed.2.The cumulative CPU time spent evaluating the residual function. In the case of JFNK, this includes the evaluations needed to form the action of the Jacobian inside the linear solver.3.The cumulative CPU time required to generate the approximate Jacobian for the preconditioning operation and to form the approximate inverse. In the last two rows of the table, the existing Jacobian matrix is used directly by the preconditioning operation, thus the preconditioner fill time is zero.4.The cumulative CPU time to perform the Jacobian-vector products or the matrix free differencing operation required by the linear solver.5.The cumulative CPU time needed to apply the preconditioner operation within the linear solver.6.The cumulative CPU time spent in the linear solver (counts the two previous columns plus time spent in GMRES orthogonalization operations, etc.7.The final column is the total wall clock time required for the overall calculation.Fig. 7 shows the convergence of the GMRES solver for both of the nonlinear solution strategies, and each of the preconditioning approaches considered. Each of the lines in each illustration shows the convergence trajectory for a particular Newton iteration at a particular loading state of the uniaxial tension test. In Fig. 7 (a) and (b), there is a small variation of convergence behavior across the ensemble of trajectories; the number of iterations required to converge the nonlinear problem varies from 118 to 155 with a mean of 138. There is more diversity when one employs a direct solver on each block of the preconditioner. In this case, the ADJ approach shows a variation between 23 and 67 iterations needed for convergence, with a mean of 40. JFNK requires more iterations for a converged solution starting at a minimum of 35 ranging to 74, with a mean of 50. The last two plots, Fig. 7 (e) and (f) show two single-block preconditioners that use the Sacado Jacobian directly. The ILU (1) method varies from 83 to 122 iterations with a mean of 102, where the ML preconditioner is the best considered in this study with a minimum of 18 and maximum of 35 iterations needed for convergence, with a mean of 27.Considering both the convergence data and the CPU times in Table 2, the first two rows of the table yield few surprises. The nonlinear convergence behavior between ADJ and JFNK are similar, which allows a detailed comparison of the performance of the ADJ method vs. JFNK on the uniaxial tension calculation. The ADJ approach develops two “analytic” Jacobians; one in block form for input to the preconditioning operation. The JFNK approach only requires formation of the block version for preconditioning purposes; thus the “Jacobian Fill” time of the JFNK calculation is half that of the ADJ approach. Moving to the right, nearly a factor of 100 more time is spent in residual function evaluation (6080\\xa0s vs. 61.44\\xa0s). This is not surprising as residual function evaluation is used to form the matrix vector product [18]\\xa0and\\xa0[23]equation (43 )J(x(k))v≈F(x(k)+εv)-F(x(k))ε,where F(x(k)) corresponds to the residual function operating on the current problem state, ε is a numerical perturbation, and v is a Krylov vector. The column headed Jv isolates the cumulative CPU time needed to form the matrix-vector product, which dominates the solution time when JFNK is used for this problem. Finally, even though the Jacobian is formed twice using Sacado in this comparison ADJ result, JFNK is over a factor of six slower than the ADJ method. It is well understood that JFNK is not practical if sufficiently effective preconditioning that limits the number of linear iterations to a small number is not available. For this problem the block Gauss–Siedel approach using ML on each block requires a mean of 138 linear iterations; too many for JFNK to be a practical solution strategy when compared with ADJ.The next two rows of Table 2 compare the two approaches using a direct solver on each block of the Gauss–Siedel preconditioner, with a goal of demonstrating a more effective block preconditioning strategy. Fig. 7 (c) indicate that the resultant preconditioner is significantly more powerful, delivering a mean number of linear iterations of 40 (ADJ) and 50 (JFNK). This reduction of linear iterations leads to a concomitant increase of performance of JFNK, with better preconditioning JFNK is two times slower than the ADJ approach.Fig. 8 shows these data, extrapolating the solver performance to zero GMRES iterations with a linear fit of the above ADJ (green line) and JFNK (red line) overall solution times. Given the limited data, it is clear that JFNK becomes competitive with the ADJ approach if preconditioning can be made sufficiently effective to limit the number of GMRES iterations to single digits per Newton iteration.The last two rows of Table 2 show the ADJ approach using both ILU (1) and AMG preconditioning applied directly to the system Jacobian. This approach is less expensive than the multi-block preconditioners as only a single Jacobian representation is computed, which results in better performance as shown in the blue curve in Fig. 8.Further work may be suggested in the study of the JFNK method considering this last result. However note that, to be competitive with this result, it would be necessary to develop a preconditioning strategy that is substantially better (and more efficient) than the use of ML on the “analytic Jacobian;” simultaneously providing significantly better performance while reducing the number of GMRES iterations per Newton to less than 10.\\nRING COMPRESSION TEST ON HB ROBINSON FUEL SAMPLES\\nIn this example, we apply the Zry4-hydride model to simulate a ring compression test on HB Robinson fuel samples and compare the results with experimental data presented by Billone et al., [3]. Figs. 14 and 20(b) in [3] show the hydride morphology that is often seen in irradiated fuel samples, as well as cracking that developed during ring compression testing.To simulate an idealized ring compression test, only a quarter of the ring needs to be modeled because of symmetry. For such a geometry, the finite element mesh and boundary conditions are shown in Fig. 9.A direct comparison was made to ring compression test data for HBR irradiated fuel [3]. The ring compression test apparatus and conditions are described in Fig. 4 and on page 434 of [3]. The results of the comparison with Fig. 15 in [3], using model data given in Table 3, are shown in Fig. 10.In the hydride model presented here, the volume fractions of the radial (fr) and circumferential (fc) hydride phases are specified independently, from an estimate of the general morphology of the specimen. For both orientation, the volume fractions are typically given in parts per million (ppm). The volume fraction of the matrix material is then fm=1.0-fc-fr .Excellent agreement was achieved with the test data, up to the point of radial hydride fracture seen at a displacement of approximately 0.4\\xa0mm. From the load–displacement data, we conjecture that a fracture occurs from the center of the test specimen outward, which results in partial load shedding. The ring does not completely fail; the fracture is arrested at some point, possibly by a circumferentially-oriented platelet. After the fracture is arrested, the material again loads, but the slope of the load–displacement is less due to the reduced cross-section of cladding being loaded. Currently, the proposed hydride model does not include fracture (or delamination) prediction capabilities; extension of the model to predict this behavior could be readily accomplished, but is left for future work.Fig. 11 (a) and (b) show the von Mises stress and pressure contours developed in the ring compression simulation. In Fig. 11(a), it is clear that the von Mises stress is concentrated where the load is applied along the center axis of the ring. The pressure field shows that the ring is in tension (positive) at the inner surface and in compression (negative) at the outer surface at the load application site. This stress concentration is consistent with the damage contours seen in Fig. 12(a) and (b).The damage contour illustrations are very interesting, in that the damage seen in the radial hydride is of much higher magnitude than in the circumferential hydride orientation. This is consistent with experimental observations in [3]. The model is able to capture this strong directional-dependence of the mechanical response of the hydride system.The model in its current form requires hydride morphology information in addition to material properties. Prior to the use of the model, the user must isolate the hydride orientations of interest and estimate the volume fraction of hydride in each orientation. Such estimates are difficult to derive and are a major source of uncertainty and potential error in the model. This limitation of the modeling strategy presented here is being addressed as a future extension to the Albany analysis tool.\\nCONCLUSION\\nA mechanical model was developed for the Zry4-hydride system representative of used reactor fuel rods. The model treats the Zry4 matrix as an elastoplastic material that contains small hydride platelets of arbitrary orientation (circumferentially and radially oriented inclusions were considered in the study). The model fits in a large-deformation hyperelasto-plastic framework, where the mechanical response of the material is derived from a stored potential energy function. The model accounts for the damage sustained by the hydride phases, as well as volume fractions of different hydride phases. The model was calibrated using as-fabricated cladding data in [6]. The calibrated model was also applied to simulate HB Robinson cladding ring compression test (RCT) experiments given in [3]. The fracture (or delamination) processes that occur in the radial hydrides during the RCT is not currently predicted by the model. The model and framework could readily be extended to properly address these behaviors, and is left for future work.The finite element framework hosting the model employs a preconditioned Newton–Krylov solution scheme to deliver robustness and efficiency to analysis applications similar to the cladding capability presented here. The Albany code leverages the Trilinos Sacado automatic differentiation package to form the system Jacobian operator required for Newton’s method. This approach is novel for nuclear materials applications, thus the performance and applicability of the method was presented in some detail in this paper. The options of directly forming the Jacobian via differentiation in code is tedious and error prone, and Jacobian-free (JFNK) approaches require strong preconditioning strategies for efficiency. Given these options, there is clearly an excellent opportunity for a new solution approach that provides the performance of a hand-coded Jacobian with the software construction and maintenance advantages of JFNK. This study demonstrates that the Sacado Jacobian (ADJ) method provides an effective “analytic Jacobian” automatically using templated residual functions, and meets these goals. Similar to the JFNK approach, the developer need not invest effort beyond creating the residual function. Unlike JFNK, the availability of the Jacobian operator allows one to reduce the amount of effort spent on preconditioner development. Indeed, the amount of work needed to form an effective (in the JFNK sense) preconditioner for multidimensional multiphysics problems on unstructured meshes can be very significant.In closing, the proposed model is able to capture the most salient future of the Zry4-hydride system, and simulation results compare well against the experimental data chosen up until the point of hydride fracture. Secondly, the Sacado Jacobian solution method provided an excellent base of implementation for this study and yielded strong performance and scalability when compared with a Jacobian-free solution approach.'"
